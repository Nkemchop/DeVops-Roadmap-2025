What is the Linux File System
The Linux file system is a multifaceted structure comprised of three essential layers. At its foundation, 
the Logical File System serves as the interface between user applications and the file system, managing operations like opening, reading, and closing files.
Above this, the Virtual File System facilitates the concurrent operation of multiple physical file systems, providing a standardized interface for compatibility. 
Finally, the Physical File System is responsible for the tangible management and storage of physical memory blocks on the disk, ensuring efficient data allocation and retrieval. 
Together, these layers form a cohesive architecture, orchestrating the organized and efficient handling of data in the Linux operating system.
In this article, we will be focusing on the file system for hard disks on a Linux OS and discuss which type of file system is suitable. 
The architecture of a file system comprises three layers mentioned below.
Linux File System Structure
A file system mainly consists of 3 layers. From top to bottom:

1. Logical File System:
The Logical File System acts as the interface between the user applications and the file system itself. 
It facilitates essential operations such as opening, reading, and closing files.
Essentially, it serves as the user-friendly front-end, ensuring that applications can interact with the file system in a way that aligns with user expectations.

2. Virtual File System:
The Virtual File System (VFS) is a crucial layer that enables the concurrent operation of multiple instances of physical file systems. 
It provides a standardized interface, allowing different file systems to coexist and operate simultaneously. 
This layer abstracts the underlying complexities, ensuring compatibility and cohesion between various file system implementations.

3. Physical File System:
The Physical File System is responsible for the tangible management and storage of physical memory blocks on the disk.
It handles the low-level details of storing and retrieving data, interacting directly with the hardware components.
This layer ensures the efficient allocation and utilization of physical storage resources, contributing to the overall performance and reliability of the file system.
