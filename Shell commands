What are Shell Commands in Linux?
A shell in Linux is a program that serves as an interface between the user and the operating system.
It accepts commands from the user, interprets them, and passes them to the operating system for execution.
The commands can be used for a wide range of tasks, from file manipulation to system management.

Some of the essential basic shell commands in Linux for different operations are:

File Management -> cp, mv, rm, mkdir
Navigation -> cd, pwd, ls
Text Processing -> cat, grep, sort, head
System Monitoring -> top, ps, df
Permissions and Ownership -> chmod, chown, chgrp
Networking – > ping, wget, curl, ssh, scp, ftp
Compression and Archiving – > tar, gzip, gunzip, zip, unzip
Package Management – > dnf, yum, apt-get
Process Management -> kill, killall, bg, killall, kill
